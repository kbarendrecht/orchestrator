# TODO

The **Live findings** block below is rewritten by the daemon every poll. It only
ever lists conditions that are true right now, so it stays worth reading.
Everything outside that block is hand-written and survives.

## Next

- **Promote the in-UI review overlay out of beta.** The overlay now does the
  real work: threads listed under the PR with their file, hunk, and a reply box,
  and replies/reactions/re-request go straight through the GitHub API
  (`src/github_write.rs`). It ships as the `resolve in ui [beta]` menu item
  beside the old `/resolve`-into-a-terminal path. What remains is deciding when
  to make the overlay the default and retire the terminal spawn. Resolving a
  thread is deliberately *not* an API call — that is the author's button, by
  design (`github_write.rs:10-13`) — so this item is about the beta gate, not
  the missing action.

- **Stacked-PR support.** Two halves. First, a context-menu `stack` action on a
  PR row that opens a session starting from that PR's code — a new branch based
  on the selected PR's head, its own worktree (cwd = main, via the existing
  `worktree-create`/`worktree-link` hooks), and an interactive session. This is
  the `/resolve` spawn machinery pointed at a *new* branch off a PR head rather
  than the PR's own branch. The stack is then detected for free: `link_stacks`
  (`src/github.rs`) already matches `child.base_ref == parent.head_ref`. Second,
  a semi-automation in the spirit of `fix-pr` — a `/restack` (or `sync`) skill
  that keeps a stack in sync: when a base PR's head moves (amend/rebase), rebase
  the children onto it bottom-up and re-push, within the existing push guards
  (`--force-with-lease` only, `push -u` ban, protected refs). Reuses the
  `PrAutomation` per-PR run model and the skill-spawn path; the bottom-up
  serialized ordering is the piece §8 described but never built. Two known
  wrinkles: the stack DAG is stored children-only (`Pr.children`), so a restack
  must derive the parent chain by inverting it — there is no `parent`/`base`
  pointer; and if it rides an agent session like `fix-pr`, the `git rebase
  --onto <new-parent-head> <old-parent-head> <child>` logic lives in the skill
  prompt (a new `prompt::RESTACK` + `vendored_prompt_file` arm), so no new Rust
  git primitive is strictly required. The per-PR-keyed guards
  (`authorship`/`branch_busy`) would need a chain-aware variant.

- **Audit the keyboard map for logical, consistent coverage.** Not two more
  chords — a pass over the whole scheme so it is predictable: same modifier
  idioms, obvious inverses, no orphan actions. Concrete gaps feeding it:
  jump-to-a-PR has no keybind at all, and `Alt+m` is a "take main" with no
  matching "release" (release today means ending the session).

- **Global kill switch / pause.** §8 lists it in the guards table; no pause state
  exists anywhere in `src/` or `web/`. One switch that stops automation from
  firing or spawning.

- Enforce the 8-process cap on *every* spawn, not just `fix-pr`. §8b caps total
  concurrent Claude processes at 8, but `MAX_CLAUDE_PROCESSES` is only checked in
  the `fix-pr` guard (`src/fix_pr.rs`); ordinary interactive and `/resolve` spawns
  bypass it.

- Paginate the *list/poll* `reviewThreads` past 50. The detailed overlay fetch
  now pages fully (`src/github.rs`, ~100/page), but the summary poll still caps
  at 50 and the PR row renders `50+` (`web/app.js`). An under-count cannot hide
  work, which was the point, but the real number is still unknown on a
  long-running PR.
- `inotify` on `.git/HEAD` per workspace (§2). The branch set is refreshed on
  reconcile instead, which is correct but lags a branch switch.

## Decisions worth revisiting

- **The changed-files pane still refreshes.** The divergence strip now carries
  the thing worth acting on when a branch has fallen behind, but the list under
  it is recomputed on reconcile. It is no longer `git status`: it is the
  merge-base changeset plus untracked files (`state.rs`, documented in
  `app.js`). Freezing it was the other reading of "it shouldn't update"; a pane
  showing a tree that no longer exists seemed worse than one showing a long
  list. Say so if you want it pinned to a snapshot with an explicit refresh
  instead.

- **`gh auth token` fallback.** Works out of the box and is what the daemon uses
  today, but its scopes include write and §6 wants read-only. Superseded as soon
  as a fine-grained PAT exists.
- **Two loosened spec rules.** The unpushed check counts commits beyond the base
  rather than blocking any never-pushed branch, and the transcript check
  distinguishes "nothing to copy" from "not copied yet". Both were unescapable
  as written. Revert if you disagree.
- **Dead shells close on a clean exit.** §2 says a dead shell keeps its buffer
  "until dismissed"; applied to every exit that made Ctrl+D leave a corpse. A
  non-zero exit still keeps its buffer.
- **`main:instances` no longer conflicts with main occupancy.** §7 rule 2 said a
  session occupying main should block a `fix-pr` e2e run (its teardown reaches
  into the main checkout). Narrowed to run-vs-run only (`src/fix_pr.rs:169-176`):
  taking main never blocks a run and vice versa, so the rule 2a wait/kill
  preemption UX is moot and was dropped. The tradeoff accepted with it: an e2e
  teardown and a live main session can touch the main checkout's instances dir /
  docker resources at the same time, unguarded. Revisit if that overlap ever
  actually bites — a non-blocking "e2e touching main" indicator would be the
  lighter fix.

## Won't do without a reason

- Adopting shell-started sessions. The daemon spawns every session so that
  `$ORCH_SESSION_ID` correlation is exact (§2); adopting one would reintroduce
  the cwd/pid heuristics the spec rejects.
- A generic "run this command" endpoint (§12).
